<blockquote cite="https://www.relay.fm/presentable/30">

    <p>"If you practice proper web centred (web native) design and use the technology the way it was intended and designed to be used, you generally create accessible things; accessibility is built in such a way that you don't have to spend much time making a separate process for it.</p>

    <p>You're not going to try and upsell performance to a client... you wouldn't want to put off people using your site in that way. The same should really go for accessibility."</p>
