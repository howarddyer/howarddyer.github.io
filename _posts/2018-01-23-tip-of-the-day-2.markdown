"Humility is the base for your ability to grow. It is the base of your ability to grow because you must be humble to learn. A rational humility understands your ability to be wrong. This is the core concept behind learning because in order to learn you must change. In order to be okay with changing you must believe that whatever you become is going to be better than what you were."
