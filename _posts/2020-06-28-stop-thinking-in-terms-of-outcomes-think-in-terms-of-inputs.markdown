    <p>"Just take the thing you know how to do, and talk about it. Don’t look for “and then you’ll get clients, and then you’ll get customers, and then you’ll get rich”... Don’t think about it that way.</p>

    <p>If you want to get healthy, get out and run 40 minutes, 5 times a week. Don’t worry about how much weight you’re going to lose, or how much body percentage you’re going to drop — stop thinking in terms of outcomes and think in terms of inputs"</p>
