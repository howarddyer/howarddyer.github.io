    <p>"Have opinions but don’t be opinionated... that’s something I would say is the mark of a good senior engineer. You understand what you know, you sort of know what you don’t know (and you’re willing to admit that you) could be wrong and (you’re) willing to let that go (rather than believing that) this is the only way and there’s no other true way."</p>
